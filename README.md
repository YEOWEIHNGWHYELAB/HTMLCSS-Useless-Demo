# HTMLCSS-Useless-Demo

This is just a revision of the HTMLCSS lecture I watch. I'm just blindly applying the things learnt in the lecture here for fun. 
And please forgive the content, as it is cringe I know, but its just a random demo of whatever I had in mind that time... 
By far this is the cringiest abomination that I have created :p tee hee. But hey it still kinda useful as it kinda consolidate my HTML & CSS learning...
